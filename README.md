# GDNFTMarketplace Contract Documentation

The GDNFTMarketplace contract is an Ethereum smart contract that enables the minting and selling of Gold Dust NFTs (GDNFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract is based on the ERC721 token standard, and uses OpenZeppelin libraries for token ownership tracking and management.

## Contract Details

- Name: GDNFTMarketplace
- ERC: ERC721URIStorage
- Symbol: GDNFT

## Contract Functions

- `constructor()`: The contract constructor function initializes the GDNFT token with the name and symbol parameters, and sets up the Counters library for tracking the token IDs and items sold.

- `updatePrimarySaleFeePercent(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the platform's primary sale fee percentage, which is taken from each original sale on the marketplace. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateSecondarySaleFeePercent(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the platform's secondary sale fee percentage, which is taken from each resale on the marketplace. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateCollectorFee(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the collector fee percentage, which is taken from each secondary sale and transferred to the artist. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateMaxRoyalty(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the maximum royalty percentage that can be set by the artist when they mint their NFT. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new maximum royalty percentage in wei format.

- `mintNft(string memory _tokenURI, uint256 _royaltyPercent)`: This function allows artists to mint a new GDNFT token and list it on the marketplace. The `_tokenURI` parameter is the URI of the token metadata, and `_royaltyPercent` is the royalty percentage that the artist wants to set for their work. The function fails if the artist is not whitelisted.

- `listNft(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: This function allows artists to list their GDNFT token on the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be listed, and the `_price` parameter is the price at which the token will be listed. The function fails if the price is less than or equal to 0.

- `buyNft(uint256 _tokenId)`: This function allows buyers to purchase a GDNFT token from the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be purchased. The function fails if the token is not listed on the marketplace, or if the buyer does not have sufficient funds to make the purchase.

- `setTokenSecondarySale(uint256 _tokenId, bool _canBeResold)`: This function allows the artist to enable or disable the ability to resell a token. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be modified, and the `_canBeResold` parameter is a boolean that indicates whether the token can be resold or not.

- `getMarketItems()`: This function returns an array of all the market items that are currently listed on the marketplace.

- `getMarketItemById(uint256 _tokenId)`: This function returns the market item that matches the specified `_tokenId`.
