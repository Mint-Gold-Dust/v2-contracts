# GDNFTMarketplace Contract Documentation

The GDNFTMarketplace contract is an Ethereum smart contract that enables the minting and selling of Gold Dust NFTs (GDNFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract is based on the ERC721 token standard, and uses OpenZeppelin libraries for token ownership tracking and management.

## Contract Details

- Name: GDNFTMarketplace
- ERC: ERC721URIStorage
- Symbol: GDNFT

## Contract Functions

- `constructor()`: The contract constructor function initializes the GDNFT token with the name and symbol parameters, and sets up the Counters library for tracking the token IDs and items sold.

- `updatePrimarySaleFeePercent(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the platform's primary sale fee percentage, which is taken from each original sale on the marketplace. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateSecondarySaleFeePercent(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the platform's secondary sale fee percentage, which is taken from each resale on the marketplace. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateCollectorFee(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the collector fee percentage, which is charged from each primary sale. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new fee percentage in wei format.

- `updateMaxRoyalty(uint256 _percentage)`: This function updates the maximum royalty percentage that can be set by the artist when they mint their NFT. Only the contract deployer can call this function. The `_percentage` parameter is the new maximum royalty percentage in wei format.

- `mintNft(string memory _tokenURI, uint256 _royaltyPercent)`: This function allows artists to mint a new GDNFT token and list it on the marketplace. The `_tokenURI` parameter is the URI of the token metadata, and `_royaltyPercent` is the royalty percentage that the artist wants to set for their work. The function fails if the artist is not whitelisted.

- `listNft(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: This function allows artists to list their GDNFT token on the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be listed, and the `_price` parameter is the price at which the token will be listed. The function fails if the price is less than or equal to 0.

- `buyNft(uint256 _tokenId)`: This function allows buyers to purchase a GDNFT token from the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be purchased. The function fails if the token is not listed on the marketplace, or if the buyer does not have sufficient funds to make the purchase.

- `updateListedNft(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: This function allows the seller to update the price of an already listed NFT the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be updated. The `_price` parameter is the new price to be set. The function fails if the token is not listed on the marketplace, if the price is less or equal to zero or if the caller is not the seller.

- `reListNft(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: This function allows an NFT owner(not original artist) to list the token on the secondary marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be listed, and the `_price` parameter is the price at which the token will be listed. The function fails if the price is less than or equal to 0 or the caller is not the owner of the token.

- `delistNft(uint256 _tokenId)`: This function allows the seller of an NFT to remove the token from the marketplace. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be removed. The function fails if the caller is not the seller of the token. When the token is removed, the `id_MarketItem[_tokenId]` struct is updated to reflect that the token has been sold. The `_itemsSold` counter is incremented since the token is no longer listed for sale. The token is transferred from the marketplace contract to the seller, and an `NftRemovedFromMarketplace` event is emitted.

- `auction(uint256 _tokenId, address _auctionContract)`: This function allows the owner of an NFT to move the token to an auction contract. The `_tokenId` parameter is the ID of the token to be moved, and the `_auctionContract` parameter is the address of the auction contract to which the token will be moved. The function fails if the caller is not the owner of the token. When the token is moved, it is transferred from the caller to the auction contract, and an `NftSentToAuction` event is emitted.

- `setValidator(address _address, bool _state)`: This function allows the contract owner to whitelist or blacklist an address as a validator. The `_address` parameter is the address to be validated, and the \_state parameter is the boolean state of the validation. The function emits a `ValidatorAdded` event when an address is added to the validator list.

- `whitelist(address _address, bool _state)`: This function allows a validator to whitelist or blacklist an artist. The `_address` parameter is the address of the artist to be whitelisted or blacklisted, and the `_state` parameter is the boolean state of the artist's approval. The function emits an `ArtistWhitelisted` event when an artist is added to the whitelist.
